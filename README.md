# COUNTER
### "Counterpart, Countermeasure, Counteract"
#### COUNTER uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a person having a disease/cancer based on the data that have been input.

Demo of the web application can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4VHfZTyW1c).

- Submtted this project as part of my Applied Machine Learning module in school. 
- Python Jupyter notebook files as well as datasets can be found in 'Source Codes and Datasets'.
- The actual web flask application is 'counter'.
